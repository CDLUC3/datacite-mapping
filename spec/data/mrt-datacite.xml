    <description descriptionType="Abstract">This 19th Orange County Annual Survey, UCI, continues to monitor social, economic and political trends. The Orange County Consumer Confidence Index now stands at 112, the highest score since the study began tracking this five-question measure in 1986, surpassing the U.S. index, which is at 109. The 2000 survey was conducted May 3-14, 2000, and includes random telephone interviews with 1,005 Orange County adults in English and Spanish.

    <description descriptionType="Methods">The 2000 Orange County Annual Survey was directed by Mark Baldassare, professor and Johnson Chair in Civic Governance at UCI, and Senior Fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California. Cheryl Katz, research associate, was co-director. The random telephone survey included interviews with 1,005 Orange County adult residents conducted May 3-14, 2000. We follow the methods used in the 18 previous surveys.

Interviewing was conducted on weekend days and weekday nights, using a computer-generated random sample of telephone numbers. Within a household, adult respondents were randomly chosen for interview. Each interview and took an average of 20 minutes to complete. The interviewing was conducted in English and Spanish as needed. The completion rate was 67%. Telephone interviewing was conducted by Interviewing Services of America in Van Nuys, CA. The sample's demographic characteristics were comparable to data from the U.S. Census, California Department of Finance, and previous Orange County Annual Surveys.

The sampling error for this survey is +/- 3% at the 95% confidence level. This means that 95 times out of 100, the results will be within 3 percentage points of what they would be if all adults in Orange County were interviewed. The sampling error for any subgroup would be larger. Sampling error is just one type of error to which surveys are subject. Results may also be affected by factors such as question wording, ordering, and survey timing.

Throughout the report, we refer to two geographic regions. North refers to cities and communities north of the 55 Freeway, including Anaheim, Orange, Villa Park, La Habra, Brea, Buena Park, Fullerton, Placentia, Yorba Linda, La Palma, Cypress, Los Alamitos, Rossmoor, Seal Beach, Westminster, Midway City, 
Stanton, Fountain Valley, Huntington Beach, Santa Ana, Garden Grove, Tustin, Tustin Foothills and Costa Mesa. South refers to cities and communities south of the 55 Freeway, including Newport Beach, Irvine, 
Lake Forest, Newport Coast, Aliso Viejo, Laguna Hills, Laguna Niguel, Laguna Woods, Mission Viejo, Portola Hills, Rancho Santa Margarita, Foothill Ranch, Coto de Caza, Trabuco, Laguna Beach, Dana Point, San Clemente, Capistrano Beach and San Juan Capistrano. In the analysis of questions on the proposed El Toro airport, we include Newport Beach in the North County.

Some of the questions in this survey are repeated from national surveys conducted by the University of Michigan in 2000, the Pew Research Center in 1999, the Wall Street Journal and NBC News in 1999, CBS News in 1999, Fox News in 2000, and the Gallup Organization in 1999. Questions with California comparisons are repeated from the Public Policy Institute of California's Statewide Surveys in 2000, directed by Mark Baldassare.</description>
