    <description descriptionType="Abstract">This year, the Orange County Annual Survey highlights growth and its effects on the quality of local life. This topic moves to the forefront in 1987 and joins traffic congestion among the most discussed issues in the county. The sample size is 1,010 Orange County adult residents.

    <description descriptionType="Methods">The Orange County Annual Survey was conducted by Mark Baldassare, a professor of social ecology at UC Irvine. For the survey, 1,010 -adult Orange County residents were interviewed by telephone Sept. 7 to 20. In Orange County, where more than 97 percent of households have telephones, this method of interview gives highly representative data.

Interviewing was conducted on weekend days and weekday nights using a random sample of listed and unlisted telephone numbers. These numbers were randomly generated by computer from a list of working blocks of telephone exchanges. Within a household, respondents were chosen for interview using the Troldahl-Carter method, which randomly selects a household member from a grid. The field work was conducted by the Center for Survey Research at UCI's Public Policy Research Organization. The telephone sample was generated by Pijacki and Associates of Shoreham, N.Y.

Each interview contained 91 questions and took an average of 20 minutes to complete. The surveys were designed in three stages over several months. In the first stage, UCI graduate students conducted focus group interviews on orange County topics with randomly selected adult residents. The second stage involved feedback on questions and topics from the Annual Survey's Advisory Committee and colleagues. The final stage involved extensive consultation with the Center for Survey Research staff, followed by pre-tests and final revisions of the questions.

The interview began with questions about housing, consumer confidence and quality of life in Orange County. These were followed by questions on growth and traffic issues. Later in the interview, we turned to the topics of localism and charities. The conclusion of the survey was devoted to questions about work and commuting status, personal and household characteristics and party politics.

The survey also included questions dedicated to the concerns of three sponsors and UCI faculty. The questions on charity, mobility and commuting are discussed in thefindings section. The other questions are not part of the Orange County Annual Survey report.
The survey's validity was checked by comparing the sample's characteristics to available information on Orange County's population. We compared the 1987 survey results to the 1980 Census, previous Annual Surveys and other recent polling data. Age, income and other demographic features of our sample were comparable with those noted in other studies. For data analyses, we statistically weighted the sample to represent the actual regional distribution of Orange County residents.

The sampling error for this survey is +/- 3 percent at the 95 percent confidence level. This means that 95 times out of 100 the results will be within 3 percentage points of what they would be if all adults in Orange County were interviewed. The sampling error for any subgroup would be larger. Sampling error is just one type of error to which surveys are subject. Results may also influenced by factors such as question wording, survey timing and interview design.</description>
