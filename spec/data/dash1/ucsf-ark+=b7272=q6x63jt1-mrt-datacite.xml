<description descriptionType="Abstract">This dataset contains the transcripts of 15 focus groups conducted in California, New York state, and Ohio from 2009-2013 concerning retailers that had voluntarily discontinued tobacco sales. Transcripts are grouped by state: FG1-8 are the California groups, FG9-13 are the New York groups, and FG14-15 are the Ohio groups.</description>
<description descriptionType="Methods">Focus groups with one moderator, and, in California, one note-taker who occasionally asked questions. All but one of the focus groups in California were conducted by the same person.  All of the New York and Ohio focus groups were conducted by the same person.</description>
