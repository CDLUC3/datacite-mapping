    <description descriptionType="Methods">The Orange County Annual Survey, UCI, was co-directed by Mark Baldassare, professor and chairof urban and regional planning, and Cheryl Katz, research associate. The random telephone survey included interviews with 1,002 Orange County adult residents between Sept. 4-Sept. 14, 1997. We follow the methods used in the 15 previous surveys. 

Interviewing was conducted on weekend days and mweekday nights, using a computer-generated random sample of telephone numbers. Within a household, adult respondents were randomly chosen for interviews. Each interview included 66 questions and took an average of 20 minutes to complete. The interviewing was conducted in English and Spanish, as needed. The completion rate for the survey was 66 percent. This rate is consistent with earlier Orange County Annual Surveys. The fieldwork was conducted by Interviewing Services of America of Van Nuys, CA. 

The survey sample was compared to the U.S. Census and state figures by city for Orange County and was found to represent the actual regional distribution of Orange County residents. The sample's demographic characteristics were also closely comparable to the census and other survey data including previous Orange County Annual Surveys. 

The sampling error for this survey is +/- 3 percent at the 95 percent confidence level. This means that 95 times out of 100, the results will be within 3 percentage points of what they would be if all adults in Orange County were interviewed. The sampling error for any subgroup would be larger. Sampling error is just one type of error to which surveys are subject. Results may also be affected by question wording, ordering, and survey timing. 

Throughout the report, we refer to four geographic regions. North County includes Anaheim, Orange, Villa Park, La Habra, Brea, Buena Park, Fullerton, Placentia and Yorba Linda. West County includes La Palma, Cypress, Los Alamitos, Rossmoor, Seal   Beach, Westminster, Midway City, Stanton, Fountain Valley and Huntington Beach. Central County includes Santa Ana, Garden Grove, Tustin, Tustin Foothills and Costa Mesa. South Countyincludes Newport Beach, Irvine, Lake Forest, Aliso Viejo, Laguna Hills, Laguna Niguel, Mission Viejo, Portola Hills, Rancho Santa Margarita, Coto de Caza, Trabuco Highlands, El Toro Station, Laguna Beach, Dana Point, San Clemente and San Juan Capistrano. In the analysis of the questions on the proposed airport, we divide the county into North County and South County, with Newport Beach included in the northern region. </description>
